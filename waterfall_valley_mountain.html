    <h2>How to speak up?</h2>
    <p>The first step in speaking up is to recognize the issue and identify how it affects you. Then, you need to decide how to communicate your thoughts. This could be through writing a letter, making a phone call, participating in a protest, or even just having a conversation with your friends or family. Whichever method you choose, make sure to be clear about what you want to say and why it matters. Finally, don’t be afraid to take a stand and be confident in your opinions.</p>
